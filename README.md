# JS_course_Wildlearner
This repository contains my progress through the WildLearner JavaScript Course. I followed each lesson step-by-step, practicing with code and building small examples to understand the basics better.  The course is beginner-friendly and helped me get comfortable with JavaScript, from simple values to working with the browser.
